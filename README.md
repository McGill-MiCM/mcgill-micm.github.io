# Welcome to the MiCM!

Data collection in the life sciences, including biomedical research in the laboratory and healthcare in the clinic, is taking place at an unprecedented scale. To respond to the opportunity of a better use of data and computational methods in Medicine, we created a new Initiative within the Faculty of Medicine: the McGill initiative in Computational Medicine (MiCM).
